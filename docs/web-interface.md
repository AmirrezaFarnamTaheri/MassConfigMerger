# üåê Web Interface

The package ships with a Flask application that provides a user-friendly interface for monitoring and managing your proxy configurations.

## Launching the server

First, install the optional dependencies:

```bash
pip install configstream[web]
```

Then, start the web server with the `daemon` command:

```bash
configstream daemon
```

By default, it listens on `http://127.0.0.1:8080`.

## Pages

The web interface includes the following pages:

-   **Dashboard:** Displays a summary of your proxy configurations, including the total number of nodes, the number of successful connections, the average ping, and the number of countries. You can also filter and sort the nodes by various criteria.
-   **Export:** Allows you to export your proxy configurations in various formats, including CSV, JSON, raw text, and base64.
