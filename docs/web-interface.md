# üåê Web Interface

ConfigStream includes a modern, Flask-based web interface that provides a user-friendly dashboard for monitoring, managing, and testing your proxy configurations.

## Launching the Server

First, ensure you have installed the optional web dependencies:

```bash
pip install -e .[web]
```

Then, start the web server with the following command:

```bash
python -m configstream.web_dashboard
```

By default, the server listens on `http://127.0.0.1:8080`.
